# Stock-Analysis
By Noah Kruse

Program Overview:

In this project I created a program that analyzes the available stocks in the United States by grabbing values from an excel sheet. Once the values are grabbed from this sheet there are several different numbers that need to be calculated to determine the worth of the stock and if the stock is a good choice to buy based on the quantitative data. You are able to get a recommendation on the selected stock that will analyze the ratios that have been calculated compared to the industry standard. All of these seperate tests are then combined ot result in a score out of 10. The higher the score is the better the stock is to buy at the moment of the spreadsheet data.

Program Instructions:
1. Program asks for Stock Name input from user
2. User inputs a company name
3. The companies found based on input are displayed
4. User picks a number to select the desired company
5. Information about company is printed
6. Program asks user if they want a recommendation on the selected stock
7. If yes is selected the program calculates the PE, FPE, PS, FPS, PB, and PEG ratios for the stock to form an overall idea. This score is translated to a value out of 10 that is then printed to the user and prints out some advide on whether to buy or to not buy. If no is selected the program loops around for the user to select another stock.

Code Conclusions:

Overall, I am fairly proud of this project because it provides a fairly accurate insite into a certain aspect of the stock market. This program is meant to be a helpful tool to check a persons investments and not a tool to take all of your stock advice from due to the stock market being much more complex than just the numbers on a spreadsheet. I think if I were to make this program over again I would implement web parsing so that the spreadsheet does not need to be downloaded everytime that the user wants an update to the stocks. I made this program before I had learned much about web design.
